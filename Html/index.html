                    name suggests it's a simple dilution of espresso, there's some nuance in how it's prepared and the
                    resulting taste.</p>

                <h3>Flat White</h3>
                <p>A flat white is a coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk, known for its smooth, velvety
                    texture and a thin layer of microfoam. It generally has a higher proportion of espresso to milk than
                    a latte, and less foam than a cappuccino.</p>

                <h3>Ristretto</h3>
                <p>A ristretto is a short shot of espresso made with the same amount of ground coffee as a standard
                    espresso but exxtracted with half the amount of water. This results in a more concentrated, intense,
                    and sweeter flavor profile compared to a standard espresso. The term "restretto" is Italian for
                    "restricted," reflecting the limited amount of water used in its preparation.</p>
